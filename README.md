# MySuperMarketList

>The project **is still in progress**.

>This is a console application that lets me choose amongst the products that I usually buy in a 
> supermarket. It then scrapes the prices for these products and creates shopping-lists(with prices)
> for 4 major supermarkets, so that I can select the cheapest.

>It also finds the cheapest solution assigning each product to the supermarket with the best price
> for it, if I want to visit all of them.
